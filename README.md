Code and models for [Coupled Ensembles of Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06053) 

The repository includes a DenseNet trainer. The configuration can be set in `train.sh`.

Note:
This is a temporary version. It does not exactly match what is described in the paper. The difference is that it does not implement yet the generic wrapper for the ensemble of branches.
Instead we provide as illustration, a specific version for DenseNet-BC.

The generic version and it should be made available very soon. Additionally, we will add pretrained model weights.
